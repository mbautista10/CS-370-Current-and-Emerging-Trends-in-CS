**Explanation of the work done on this project**

*What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?*

The class provided a skeleton implementation for the final project to complete the deep Q-learning algorithm. In addition, the course provided two python classes, the first class, TreasureMaze.py, represented the environment. The second class, GameExperience.py, stored all the states/episodes that came in between the first state and the terminal state. 
With the skeleton provided, I implemented a deep Q-learning algorithm to find the best possible navigation sequence to reach the goal while maximizing the reward and determining the best number of epochs to achieve a 100% winning rate.

*What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?*

Computer scientists have different roles in the IT sector. However, the most critical role is to use current technologies to solve complex computational problems. Therefore, this is important because it helps in future research and development of future technologies. 

*How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?*

As a computer scientist, the first step to approaching a problem is identifying and defining what needs solving or creating. Then I would examine what my possible solutions to the problem are. After that, I would evaluate all my options and choose the best solution. Finally, I would implement the solution chosen and assess the outcome. 

*What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?*

My ethical responsibilities to the end user are avoiding harm, being fair, avoiding discrimination, and respecting their privacy. My ethical responsibilities to an organization are maintaining high standards of professional competence and providing comprehensive evaluations of computer systems and their impacts.
